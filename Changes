I write 3 things can make yacs better

1. The study quacs home page first lists all the majors for users to choose from, which allows users to find the course they are looking for more intuitively.
2.Join the summer arch course selection (may already have it, but it is not currently updated on the website)
3.Automatically exclude full courses when selecting a course
